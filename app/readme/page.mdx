# Max Stoiber's README

Hi, I‚Äôm Max üëã If I sent you this, it's because we will work together and I want to set us up for success! The below is a concise user guide to explain what I care about, how I think, and some fun facts.

At a high level, I identify as an [ENFP](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) and a [Type 3](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-3/) (with a bit of [Type 9](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9/)) Enneagram.

## What I care about: quality, impact, and people

- **Quality:** I love creating things of high quality.

  - In software, I believe to get to high quality, we need to make it work, make it right, then make it fast‚Äîin that order. ([more info](https://mxstbr.com/notes/taste#make-it-work-make-it-right-make-it-fastin-that-order))

  - I pride myself on my taste in product and especially developer experience, and I work hard to develop it further. ([more info](https://mxstbr.com/notes/taste))

  - Shopify‚Äôs maniacal focus on craftsmanship deeply resonates with me.

- **Impact:** I love creating things of high quality _that impact the world significantly_.

  - Some of the open source projects I co-created (like [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)) permanently influenced how the millions of software engineers in the React.js ecosystem think.

    - That felt deeply fulfilling, so impacting the world has become a core driving force for me.

- **People:** I love creating things of high quality that impact the world significantly _with great people._

  - As an ENFP, I love connecting with people, especially those who love to create.

  - As a manager, I believe that teams with deeper personal connections perform better. Thus, I focus on making sure my people are well-connected on a personal level.

    - I use 1:1s to connect with my reports, not project updates. ([more info](https://mxstbr.com/notes/1-on-1s))

## How I think

- As an ENFP, I‚Äôm an **intuition**-based decision-maker. This means:

  - My brain‚Äôs dominant thinking function is extraverted intuition, meaning my brain creates a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù based on all the information I‚Äôve collected that I can ‚Äúfeel out‚Äù to make decisions.

  - To retain specifics, I take copious notes in every meeting.

  - I utilize active listening tools to confirm that my brain captured the core information, so I will often repeat back what I understood from what you said.

- I **write to think**

  - Writing helps me bring focus to the graph in my brain. It‚Äôs also how I clarify and challenge my intuition.

- I always assume **good intent**

  - I believe people generally do things for good reasons, so I try hard to understand those reasons.

    - I ask that you extend the same courtesy to me.

  - Tension between people is often created when their intent isn‚Äôt well surfaced‚ÄîI work hard to surface and understand the reasons behind people‚Äôs intent.

- I **strive to be the best** at the things I care about

  - I am not a jack of all trades, and that‚Äôs intentional.

  - I am intentional about being various levels of world-class at a handful of things (e.g. table tennis, skiing, specialty coffee, Mario Kart, being a dad), and I love doing those things.

- I **love getting feedback and I‚Äôm working on being better at giving feedback.**

  - I strive for rapid iteration of myself as a person. That‚Äôs why I value differing perspectives and seek feedback in everything I do.

  - The times of explosive growth in my life happened when I was in dynamic situations where I was reflected back to me. This enabled me to see the diff in who I thought I was, how I thought I was presenting, and how I was perceived externally.

- I‚Äôm happy to **change my mind**

  - Because the main thing I care about is making an impact, I have no problem changing my mind if a better reasoning or path comes up.

## Fun facts

- I was born and raised in Vienna, Austria.

  - Very few things in life are better than a good loaf of warm, fresh Austrian bread.

- Being world-class is a bit of a family trait

  - I‚Äôm the eldest of three; my sister is an up-and-coming artist, and my brother is an up-and-coming tennis pro.

  - My mom is a world-class trauma surgeon and cellist.

  - My 70-y/o dad is [a world-class Twitter troll](https://x.com/stoiber_manfred/status/1675202927051546624/photo/1).

- Rock climbing (specifically bouldering) is the next thing that I‚Äôd like to spend time becoming world-class in.

- I speak fluent German and English, and a bit of high-school French.

- I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my partner Sue, and our three kids.

  - Ages 11, 8, and 5 (as of 2024)

- There is [a short documentary movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq3xhik8tE) from many years ago about my early career in open source that has over 100K views: 

- I saw the color red for the first time in my life on my 24th birthday.

- I‚Äôm a certified Austrian skiing instructor and spend much of my winters on the slopes with our kids.¬† Here is [a video from a ski touring trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kDOIwzTfE) I went on with some friends to the Lyngen alps in the far north of Norway.

- I‚Äôm a personal productivity nerd; I deeply enjoy getting better at using my tools. I did a short session with the Raycast team explaining how I use [Raycast x Karabiner Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5MDv9qwhU8) to navigate my computer at super-speed.

- I love electronic music, especially drum and bass. You will often find me at concerts/festivals/clubs on the weekends when artists that I like are in town.
