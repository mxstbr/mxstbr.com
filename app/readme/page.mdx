# My README

Hi, I‚Äôm Max üëã If I sent you this, it's because we will work together and I want to set us up for success. The below is a user guide of sorts to explain what I care about, how I think, and some fun facts.

## What I care about: shipping impactful things quickly with great people

> ‚ÄúHorizon is a major leap forward for our merchants, and it wouldn‚Äôt have happened without the intensity, focus, and execution you brought to the team. Big delivery.‚Äù ‚Äì Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify ([source](https://mxs.is/intense))

- **Impact:** Shipping impactful things‚Ä¶

  - Early in my career some of the open source projects I co-created (like [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)) permanently influenced how the millions of software engineers in the React.js ecosystem build their apps.

  - That gave me a great sense of fulfillment, therefore shipping impactful things is now the bar for any work that I do.

- **Speed:** ‚Ä¶quickly‚Ä¶

  - Good and fast aren't a tradeoff, you can have both. I love nothing more than proving this by shipping extremely ambitious things quickly.

  - Some examples: 1) how we shipped Horizon at Shopify ([mxs.is/intense](https://mxs.is/intense)) 2) [this inspiring collection of examples](https://patrickcollison.com/fast) by Patrick Collison

- **People:** ‚Ä¶with great people.

  - In my experience, shipping ambitious things quickly requires a team of great people that are all going at it together. So those are the kinds of teams I strive to build.

## How I think

- As an ENFP, I‚Äôm an **intuition**-based decision-maker.

  - My brain creates a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù based on all the information I‚Äôve collected that I can ‚Äúfeel out‚Äù to make decisions.

  - To retain specifics, I take copious notes in every meeting.

  - I will often repeat back what I understood from what you said to confirm our shared understanding.

- I **write to think**

  - Writing helps me bring focus to the graph in my brain. It‚Äôs also how I clarify and challenge my intuition.

- I always assume **good intent**

  - I believe people do things for good reasons, so I try hard to understand those reasons.

  - I ask that you extend the same courtesy to me.

- I **strive to be the best** at the things I care about

  - I am not a jack of all trades, and that‚Äôs intentional.

  - I am intentional about being various levels of world-class at a handful of things (e.g. table tennis, skiing, specialty coffee, Mario Kart, being a dad), and I love doing those things.

- I **love getting and giving feedback.**

  - I strive for rapid iteration of myself as a person. That‚Äôs why I value differing perspectives and seek feedback in everything I do.

  - The times of explosive growth in my life happened when I was in dynamic situations where I was reflected back to me. This enabled me to see the diff in who I thought I was, how I thought I was presenting, and how I was perceived externally.

- I‚Äôm happy to **change my mind**

  - Because the main thing I care about is making an impact, I have no problem changing my mind if a better reasoning or path comes up. I have low attachment to my thoughts, ideas, or opinions and will happily be convinced of a better decision.

## Fun facts

- I was born and raised in Vienna, Austria.

  - Very few things in life are better than a good loaf of warm, fresh Austrian bread.

- Being world-class is a bit of a family trait

  - I‚Äôm the eldest of three; my sister is an up-and-coming artist, and my brother is an up-and-coming tennis pro.

  - My mom is a world-class trauma surgeon and cellist.

  - My 70-y/o dad is [a world-class Twitter troll](https://x.com/stoiber_manfred/status/1675202927051546624/photo/1).

- Rock climbing (specifically bouldering) is the next thing that I‚Äôd like to spend time becoming world-class in.

- I speak fluent German and English, and a bit of high-school French.

- I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my partner Sue, and our three kids.

  - Ages 11, 8, and 5 (as of 2024)

- There is [a short documentary movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq3xhik8tE) from many years ago about my early career in open source that has over 100K views: 

- I saw the color red for the first time in my life on my 24th birthday.

- I‚Äôm a certified Austrian skiing instructor and spend much of my winters on the slopes with our kids.¬† Here is [a video from a ski touring trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kDOIwzTfE) I went on with some friends to the Lyngen alps in the far north of Norway.

- I‚Äôm a personal productivity nerd; I deeply enjoy getting better at using my tools. I did a short session with the Raycast team explaining how I use [Raycast x Karabiner Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5MDv9qwhU8) to navigate my computer at super-speed.

- I love electronic music, especially drum and bass. You will often find me at concerts/festivals/clubs on the weekends when artists that I like are in town.
