# Angel Investing

Together with [Sue Odio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sueodio/), I angel invest small ($2.5k - $5k) checks in early-stage startups we're excited about. Think of us as advisors with skin in the game — we love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to our networks and audiences, or even just lending an ear.

> Max is one of our highest value-add investors: he constantly gives us good product feedback and knows everything about open source.
> On top of that, every time he talks about us to his developer audience our stats go wild.
> – Brendan Falk, CEO at Fig

If you're founding a startup and think this could be a good fit we'd love to meet you. [Send us an email](mailto:angel@mxstbr.com) and let's chat!

## What we invest in

We invest first-and-foremost in the people. Our main filter is "Do we believe these founders can go through the one-of-a-kind challenge of building a company that can change the world?"

We love investing early to make the most of the limited amount of money we have. The earlier, the better.

I personally love investing in products that I (would) use myself, even more so if they're products aimed at developers.

## Investments

So far, I have invested in:

<ItemList>
  {investments.map((investment) => (
    <li
      className="pl-0 list-none"
      key={investment.href}
    >
      <div className="flex flex-1 items-center space-x-4 pl-0">
        <div className="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100 shrink-0">
          <a target="_blank" href={investment.href}>

          </a>
        </div>
        <span
