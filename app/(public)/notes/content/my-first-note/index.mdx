# My First Note

This is my first note in my digital garden. It's a **seedling** 🌱 - a new idea that I'm just starting to explore.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas, rather than a blog of polished posts. Notes here are:

- **Living documents** that grow and change over time
- **Interconnected** through tags and links
- **In various stages** of development (seedling → budding → evergreen)

## Getting Started

This note demonstrates the basic structure:

- Clear title and summary
- Status indicator (🌱 seedling, 🌿 budding, 🌲 evergreen, 🔗 link)
- Tags for organization
- Markdown content with standard formatting

Feel free to explore, and remember - these are thoughts in progress, not final conclusions!
